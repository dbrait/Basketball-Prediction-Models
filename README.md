# Basketball-Prediction-Models

Repo is used to create models that predict the final scores of basketball games.  For now it is limited to the NBA.

Data Sources include: ESPN, Basketball Reference, NBA Savant and the NBA.com Tracking API.

Several different types of analysis on the data including: looking at specific trends using synergy data, building out a rapm model
(real plus minus, a regression based model that tries to evaluate players without the context of their team or opponent) and a markov
model that uses tracking data to create a bottom up model (by far most the ambitious project and still very much a work in progress).
